# bezen_assignment

The whole assignment was done in Colab. 
Colab a free cloud hosted jupyter services. I've been using colab for all my projects as my personal laptop doesn't have GPU but Colab provides GPU, TPU. 
Thoug this partciular task doesn't require GPU. Colab is always computationally effective than laptops with basic config. 

You won't be needing any requirements.txt file as every installation is also written in the code cell in notebook.

Upload the given file to colab. 
Go to Runtime -> Runall. 

The code will run without any issue.

Data Visualization.

I couldn't use Google data studio for visualization due to the large size of the file.

First Cut Solution

I focused on submitting the assignment sooner as there was a strong stress on the deadline.And there is always room for improvement.
